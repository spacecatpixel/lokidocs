# Wallets
The Loki wallets are a gateway into private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold private keys, secure or mine Loki, and trade peer-to-peer. 

Loki wallets store a collection of public and private keys which can be used to receive, view, or spend Loki. 

The wallet uses the private keys through a daemon which synchronises with the Loki Network to scan for incoming transactions and to send outgoing transactions.
