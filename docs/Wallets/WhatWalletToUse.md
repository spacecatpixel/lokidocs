title: Loki Documentation | Which wallet should I use?
description: Do you need help choosing which wallet to use in the Loki Network? Maybe you want to stake to a Service Node or send a transaction to a friend. Loki has multiple wallets, including the desktop GUI, desktop CLI, Android and iOS wallets, and browser-based wallets.

# Which wallet should I use?

Loki wallets are a gateway into private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold private keys and secure, mine, stake or trade Loki. Each wallet is designed for specific groups of users, depending on their goal and level of expertise.

The different wallets currently available are:

- Graphical user interface wallet (GUI)

- Command-line interface wallet (CLI)

- Mobile wallet

- Web wallet

## Use cases

Before deciding which wallet you want to use, you must first know what you want the wallet for.

### Receiving and sending Loki

All Loki wallets can receive and send Loki; however, some are much easier to use than others for this specific purpose.

The easiest wallets to use for sending and receiving Loki are:

- Graphical user interface wallet (GUI)  

- Mobile wallet

The GUI wallet can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-electron-gui-wallet/releases), while the mobile wallet can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

### Hosting a Service Node as an operator

If your goal is to host and operate a Loki Service Node, there is only one wallet that offers the ability to register a Service Node: the command-line interface wallet (CLI) which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases).

To better understand how to prepare, register and maintain a Service Node, check out this guide [here](../ServiceNodes/SNFullGuide.md).

### Staking to a Service Node as a contributor

Do you have at least 25% of the staking requirement for a Loki Service Node, and want to contribute to a Service Node pool?

If so, you will want to either use the:

- Graphical user interface wallet (GUI), or the

- Command-line interface wallet (CLI)

If you rarely use the terminal or command line, it is recommended that you perform your stake through the GUI wallet which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-electron-gui-wallet/releases). Alternatively, if you would like to perform the stake on the CLI wallet, you can download it [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases).
