## 2. Incident response

1. Researcher submits report via PGP encrypted email to the relevant Disclosure manager (DA), use the appropriate public keys listed in [section 1](#1-points-of-contact-for-security-issues) to contact specific DA’s, the subject of the email should be “Vulnerability disclosure”

2. In no more than 3 working days, the DA should respond to the researcher using  encrypted, secure channels

3. DA makes inquiries to satisfy any needed information to confirm if submission is indeed a vulnerability
    - a. If submission proves to be vulnerable with PoC code / exploit, proceed to next step
    - b. If not vulnerable:
    <ul>
      <li>*i*. DA responds with reasons why submission is not a vulnerability</li>
      <li>*ii*. DA moves discussion to a new or existing ticket on GitHub if necessary</li>
    </ul>
4. DA Establishes severity of vulnerability:
    - a. **HIGH**: impacts network as a whole, has potential to break entire Loki network, or service nodes, could result in the loss of Loki.
    - b. **MEDIUM**: impacts individual nodes, routers, wallets, or must be carefully exploited
    - c. **LOW**: is not easily exploitable or is low impact
    - d. If there are any disputes regarding bug severity, the Loki Foundation will ultimately define bug severity


5. Respond according to the severity of the vulnerability:
    - a. **HIGH** severities must be notified on website and reddit [/r/LokiProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/LokiProject/) within 3 working days of classification
    <ul>
       <li>*i*. The notification should list appropriate steps for users to take, if any</li>
       <li>*ii*. The notification must not include any details that could suggest an exploitation path</li>
       <li>*iii*. The latter takes precedence over the former</li>
    </ul>
    - b. **MEDIUM** and **HIGH** severities will require a Point Release
    - c. **LOW** severities will be addressed in the next Regular Release

6. DA and Loki project team will apply appropriate patch(es)
    - a. DA designates a PRIVATE git "hotfix branch" to work in
    - b. Patches are reviewed with the researcher
    - c. Any messages associated with PUBLIC commits during the time of review should not make reference to the security nature of the PRIVATE branch or its commits
    - d. Vulnerability announcement is drafted
    <ul>
       <li>*i*. Include the severity of the vulnerability</li>
       <li>*ii*. Include all vulnerable systems/apps/code</li>
       <li>*iii*. Include solutions (if any) if patch cannot be applied</li>
    </ul>
    - e. Release date is discussed

7. At release date, DA coordinates with developers to finalize update:
    - a. Response Manager propagates the "hotfix branch" to trunk
    - b. Response Manager includes vulnerability announcement draft in release notes
    - c. Proceed with the Point or Regular Release

## 3. Post-release disclosure process

1. The DA has 90 days to fulfill all points within [section 2](#2-incident-response)

2. If the Incident Response process in [section 2](#2-incident-response) is successfully completed:
    - a. Researcher decides whether or not to opt out of receiving name/handle/organization credit. By default, the researcher will receive name/handle/organization credit.
    <ul>
       <li>*i*. If bounty is applicable, release bounty to the researcher as defined in section "Bounty Distribution"</li>
    </ul>
    - b. Finalize vulnerability announcement draft and include the following:
    <ul>
       <li>*i*. Project name and URL</li>
       <li>*ii*. Versions known to be affected</li>
       <li>*iii*. Versions known to be not affected (for example, the vulnerable code was introduced in a recent version, and older versions are therefore unaffected)</li>
       <li>*iv*. Versions not checked</li>
       <li>*v*. Type of vulnerability and its impact</li>
       <li>*vi*. If already obtained or applicable, a CVE-ID</li>
       <li>*vii*. The planned, coordinated release date</li>
       <li>*viii*. Mitigating factors (for example, the vulnerability is only exposed in uncommon, non-default configurations)</li>
       <li>*ix*. Workarounds (configuration changes users can make to reduce their exposure to the vulnerability)</li>
       <li>*x*. If applicable, credits to the original reporter</li>
    </ul>
    - c. Release finalized vulnerability announcement on website and reddit 
    - d. If applicable, developers request a CVE-ID
    <ul>
       <li>*i*. The commit that applied the fix is made reference too in a future commit and includes a CVE-ID</li>
    </ul>


3. If the Incident Response process in section 2 is not successfully completed:
    - a. DA and developers organize a meeting to discuss why/what points in [section 2](#2-incident-response) were not resolved and how the team can resolve them in the future
    - b. If disputes arise about whether or when to disclose information about a vulnerability, the DA will publicly discuss the issue via IRC and attempt to reach consensus
    - c. If consensus on a timely disclosure is not met (no later than 90 days), the researcher (after 90 days) has every right to expose the vulnerability to the public

## 4. Bounty Amount and distribution
<ul>
<li>The Total Pool of Loki bounties is 100,000 LOK this will decrease over time as bugs are claimed, rewards are given as a percentage of the reward pool size, incentivizing fast disclosure</li>
<li>Bug bounties are rewarded by the severity of the Bug </li>
  <ol>
     <li style="margin-left:3em"> 10% reserved for LOW severity bugs</li>
     <li style="margin-left:3em"> 30% reserved for MEDIUM severity bugs</li>
     <li style="margin-left:3em"> 60% for HIGH severity bugs</li>
  </ol>
<li>Each bug will receive **at most 10%** of their relevant category dependent on the inter-category classification by the DA, the DA also reserves the right to give less than the 10% specified depending on the severity of the bug.</li>
</ul>
