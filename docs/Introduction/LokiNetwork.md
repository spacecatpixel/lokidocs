# Loki Network

## Wallets
Wallets offer a gateway to private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold, secure and trade Loki with peers. [Download an official Loki wallet](https://loki.network/getting-started/) today and start taking back control of your online privacy.

## Mining
Mining on the Loki Network is the process of solving a difficult computational puzzle through a Proof-of-Work(PoW) protocol and compiling newly created transactions into a block. The miners do this in order to earn money from the [Block Reward](/Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#block-reward) and the fees associated from the transactions they have compiled. 

The Loki cryptocurrency can be mined through the CryptoNight Heavy hashing algorithm, which is innately [ASIC Resistant](../Mining/ASICResistance.md).

## Service Nodes

>> Beef up

>>Loki utilises a network of [Service Nodes](../ServiceNodes/SNOverview.md) who are paid to propagate the blockchain, process transactions, [route traffic](../Lokinet/LLARP.md) and [messages](../LokiServices/Messenger.md) on [Lokinet](../Lokinet/LokinetOverview.md).

## Lokinet

Lokinet is a new type of mixnet that uses market-based [Sybil attack resistance](../Advanced/SybilResistance.md) and [onion routing](../Lokinet/LLARP.md) to create a new way to privately access the [internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KzH_eyX99A&t=2m48s). Users of Lokinet will be able to access normal websites and [SNApps](../Lokinet/SNApps.md) without revealing their IP address.

SNApps are traditional web applications that sit inside Lokinet and are hidden from the rest of the internet. The host’s IP is never revealed, therefore SNApps provide great protection for the development of censorship resistant social media, marketplaces, information sharing sites, and other apps that depend on user and server anonymity.
